VectorAttackScanner
===================

This is a tool to analyze android, linux and windows, to detect points to attack, as intents, receivers, services, processes and libraries.

I do thanks a good friend: Engineer Ivan Javier Sanchez (https://ar.linkedin.com/in/nullcode), for teach me about this and somethings more (y) 

This tool uses a static analysis methods to do this, the vector attack founded by this tool, can be attacked by fuzzing methods to discover vulnerabilities..

More security researchers, bug hunters, exploit writers, malware developers find a problems in the binaries to do your jobs, with this tool is more easy, this tool search by you.

Now i do testing about PIE/ASLR in Android, coming soon i upload the source ...
